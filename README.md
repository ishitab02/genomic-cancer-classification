# Cancer Type Classification from Gene Expression Data

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts cancer tissue-of-origin from gene expression (RNA-Seq) data. It utilizes public genomic datasets (e.g. TCGA) and applies dimensionality reduction and classification models to accurately classify cancer types based on gene expressionÂ profiles.
